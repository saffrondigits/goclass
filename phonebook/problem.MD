Question 2: Phonebook Lookup

Write a program that acts as a simple phonebook lookup. The program should use a map to store the contact information, where the key is the contact name (string) and the value is a struct representing the contact with fields for Name (string) and Phone number (string). The program should provide the following functionalities:

Add a contact: Prompt the user to enter the contact's name and phone number, and add it to the phonebook.
Lookup a contact: Prompt the user to enter a contact name, and display the corresponding phone number if it exists in the phonebook.
List all contacts: Display all the contacts in the phonebook, along with their phone numbers.
