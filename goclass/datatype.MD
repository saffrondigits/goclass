int8, int16, int32, int64: Signed integers of specific sizes.
uint8, uint16, uint32, uint64: Unsigned integers of specific sizes.
float32, float64: Floating-point numbers.
complex64, complex128: Complex numbers.
Strings:
string: Represents a sequence of characters.


Collections:

array: Fixed-size collection of elements of the same type.
slice: Variable-length collection of elements of the same type.
map: Key-value pairs collection.
struct: User-defined composite data type.


Pointers:

*: Represents a memory address of a value.
nil: Represents a null or uninitialized pointer.
Functions:

func: Represents a function type.
Interfaces:

interface: Defines a set of methods that a type must implement.
Others:
