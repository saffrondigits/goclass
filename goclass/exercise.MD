Question 1: Student Grade Calculation

Write a program that calculates the average grade of students. The program should use a map to store the student information, where the key is the student's name (string) and the value is a struct representing the student with fields for Name (string) and Grades ([]int). The program should prompt the user to enter the student's name and their grades (multiple grades can be entered). It should then calculate the average grade for each student and display the results.
